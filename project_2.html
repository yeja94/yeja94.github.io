                        <h2>Are Video Games Really The Cause Of Gun Deaths In The United State?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Apparently, video games are to blame for gun violent and death according to <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/280812064539283457?lang=en">
                            President Trump</a>. 
                            As a gamer myself for many years, I could see a potential correlation for the player and game. 
                            I want to do a small project on this, mainly for my own interest. Are violent video games really causing the death of people in America? 
                            If so, which game publisher is to blamed? With recent available reports and datasets from online sources, I can prove that President Trump is either right or wrong.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Objective</h3>
                        <p>
                            To find out the correlation between video game sale revenue and death count by gun in the US.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Datasets</h3>
                        <p>
                            Video game sales as of January 2017 by Zachery Hill and Mass shooting occurring in the US from 2000 – 2016 
                            by Christ Awram on data.world. Both spreadsheets are in csv files which contain 10+ columns.                        
                        </p>
                        <h3>Strategy</h3>
                        <p>
                            At least three worksheets and one dashboard for visualization. For the colors, I have chosen a different color 
                            for individual publisher. For the graphs, I have chosen bar graph, line graph, and treemap chart.                       
                        </p>
                        <h3>Data Cleaning & Modeling</h3>
                        <p>
                            The datasets were clean and straightforward. I had to omit a few columns such as case, shooting type, summary, 
                            illness in the Mass shooting occurring in the US file, in order to keep the necessary information such as the number 
                            of death and year.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I did an inner join intersection with the two files using the foreign key “year”, because I wanted to combine data or 
                            rows from their tables based on a common field.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Dashboard</h3>
                        <figure>
                          <div class="col-md-6-1">
                            <a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/AreVideoGamesReallyRelatedtoGunDeathsinUS/Dashboard1?:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link">
                              <img src="images/img3.png" alt="" class="img-fluid img-rounded">

                          </div>
                        </figure>
                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p>
                            My primary focus was to compare datasets in the U.S. Based on what I have found, gaming does correlate with gun violent. 
                            Over the course of years, more death happens when cerntain video games, gun and fighting, sale rises. In addition, I was 
                            curious about which game company had the most revenue in the past years. Expectedly, action, shooting, and sport were the most popular genres. 
                            Activision have had a total of $853 million sale revenue in action and shooter genres. Having its most popular gaming 
                            title, Call-of-Duty, it is safe to say that Activision could be the major issue of gun violence.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As much as I hate to admit it, President Trump does have a point and may be right about video games being a major issue for gun deaths. 
                            Even though President Trump was correct at a certain degree, there was no solid connection between massing shooting and video games. 
                            This small study of analysis only shows one country, North America...but what about the rest of the world?
