                                            Apparently, video games are to blame for gun violent and death according to <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/280812064539283457?lang=en">
                                            President Trump</a>. As a gamer myself for many years, I am surprised to hear that. Are video games really related to gun death in America? If so, which game 
                                            publisher is to blame? With recent available reports and datasets from online sources, I can prove that President Trump is either right or wrong.

                                            The datasets were clean and straightforward. I had to omit a few columns such as case, 
                                            shooting type, summary, illness in the Mass shooting occurring in the US file, in order to keep the

                                            I did an inner join intersection with the two files using the foreign key “year”, because I wanted to combine data or rows from their tables based on a common field.

                                            My primary focus is comparing datasets in the US. Based on what I have found, gaming does correlate with gun violent. 
                                            Over the course of years, more death happens when video game sale rises. In addition, I am curious about which game company
                                            has the most revenue in the past years. Expectedly, action, shooting, and sport is the most popular genre. Activision have had a total 
                                            of $853 million sale revenue in action and shooter genre. Having its most popular gaming title, Call-of-Duty, it is safe to say 
                                            that Activision could be the major issue of gun violence.  
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="p-width">
                                            As much as I hate to admit it, but President Trump does have a point and may be right about video games being a major issue for gun deaths. Even though President Trump is correct at a certain degree, there is no proven connection between massing shooting and video games. The data above only shows North America.
